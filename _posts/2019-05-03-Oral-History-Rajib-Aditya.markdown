Late in the year 1990 I met Tim and Sharon Hansen, Fulbright scholars who were touring India. Although they were a good 30 years older than me, we hit off well. Tim gave me a manuscript of a book he was co-authoring, called _"Parallels: The Soldiers' Knowledge And The Social Definition Of War."_

The manuscript consisted largely of interviews with Vietnam war veterans, reliving their war experience.  In the introduction the authors mention:

>This material was made available to us through a unique and interesting process. In the spring of 1989, the interdisciplinary Vietnam Studies Program at the University of Puget Sound began a series of exchanges with the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Program at the American Lake Veterans' Hospital near Tacoma, Washington. Our students believe that the war in Vietnam, and its aftermath have been slighted in their education, and the veterans find it therapeutic to communicate with an age group they have long distrusted. Participation is purely voluntary on both sides. Veterans come to the campus for "Vets' Nights" and our students go to the hospital to record their oral histories.

What motivated the authors to choose this particular form of documenting history? They explain in their introduction:

>We believe that the first-hand memories of soldiers provide a reliable, critical perspective on contemporary wars. Even a cursory reading of these narratives reveals devastating criticisms of various "official" views of warfare. Formal analyses by retired officers, historians, political leaders, and academicians have been privileged in public debate. As Michel Foucault and his followers have shown, the public have been taught to think that abstract, cognitive analyses of war are more objective, more in-depth, and more reliable than the soldier's knowledge. Veterans are thereby marginalized, ignored or overlooked and unable to make their voices heard. Our intention is to empower the soldier's knowledge by making it available to the public in published, and therefore more authoritative form. These recollections – history from the bottom up – present damaging criticisms of military definitions of war.

This is what lies at the heart of oral history. History from the bottom up. 

According to the Oral History Association, the term oral history refers to "a method of recording and preserving oral testimony" which results in a verbal document that is "made available in different forms to other users, researchers, and the public." 

Oral history can be powerful, because it relives trauma, pain, anguish. It can expose personal histories, family histories. It can reveal life in small nondescript villages and shanties that academics have ignored. It can throw you right into the blood and gore, the chaos and bedlam of war.

Here is one such account from Hansen's manuscript:

> I was flying through the air, hit the ground, slid into the ditch. The jeep came flying in on top of me… There wasn't much left of Junkie… His whole upper torso was gone. I lost it… I just lost it. I was trapped under the jeep, all this shit was going on, and I couldn't get out. I was bleeding through the mouth. I was trapped under the jeep for a good 20 minutes while explosions were going on around me. I couldn't holler to anyone… And I really freaked out. They almost missed me. They got me out and I was flown back in to Duc Pho where they had an aid station. I came out of that with just cracked ribs and some bad lungs. 
>
> The only other significant thing during this time was the first time I was in close combat. We got overrun one night. They got through to us. They came through the wire near the bunker I was in. Bunkers are L-shaped so explosions can't get straight into them. When they penetrated the wire one man in the bunker was to go out to the back door. I went running around the corner and ran straight into a sapper. We both hit the ground… And I remember just freaking out. I had to back up to shoot him. It was weird… Everything in his head was gone. His face was there, but the eye sockets were empty. I emptied his whole head out, and it all happened in an instant.

The authors are all too aware of the problems that a historian faces when using oral recollections. Especially in the theatre of war. They quote _David Hackworth, author of "About Face"_:

>The [...] problem is that they have their genesis in the fog of war. In battle, your perception is often only as wide as your battle sights. Five participants in the same action, fighting side-by-side, will often tell entirely different stories of what happened, even within hours of the fight. The story each man tells might be virtually unrecognizable to the others. But that does not make it any less true. 

Nevertheless, Hansen and the other authors say: The soldiers' knowledge in these narratives has a number of claims to its authority.

In June 1944, United States Army historian Forrest C. Pogue picked up a wire recorder on a hospital ship off Omaha Beach and began interviewing soldiers wounded in D-Day battles. His interviews, done under the direction of chief army historian S. L. A. Marshall, helped lay the groundwork for the development of oral history as a research techn

The genre grew in volume and stature after the war. It was largely fueled by a sizeable body of literature on World War II, especially the Holocaust. These have employed the category of "memory" to explore lived experiences of survivors of traumatic events that conventional historical methods cannot cap

But is memory accurate? Such works on traumatic experiences have often been criticized. The authenticity of the telling questioned.

The authors of _"Survivors: An Oral History of the Armenian Genocide"_, reply:

>We actually have some sympathy with the charge that survivors remember "tales of horror ... in such detail as to astonish the imagination." Indeed, we ourselves have often been amazed by the specificity of survivor recall. However, rather than discrediting the testimony because of its detailed nature, we have been drawn to ask a different question: namely, what accounts for the remarkable quality of survivor memory?	
>
>We believe the answer to this question lies in the exceptional nature of the events described: fathers being shot or tortured, mothers and siblings being sexually abused, children being abducted, and a litany of other horrors. Such memories are not easily forgotten. Indeed, they seem to be burned irrevocably into the consciousness of survivors. They dream about them at night. They have an incessant, even obsessive, need to talk about these events.

_Alessandro Portelli_, author of _"The Order Has Been Carried Out- History, Memory, And Meaning Of A Nazi Massacre In Rome"_, writes:

>One of the differences between oral and written sources is that the latter are documents while the former are always acts. Oral sources are not to be thought of in terms of nouns and objects but in terms of verbs and processes; not the memory and the tale but the remembering and the telling. Oral sources are never anonymous or impersonal, as written documents may often be. The tale and the memory may include materials shared with others, but the rememberer and the teller are always individual persons who take on the task of remembering and the responsibility of telling. Settimia Spizzichino, the only woman survivor among the Jews deported on October 16, 1944, said: "I made a promise when I was in the camp, I made a solemn promise to my companions, who were being picked out [to be killed] or dying from disease and abuse. I rebelled, I didn't know whether to curse God or pray to Him, and repeated over and over, Lord save me, save me, because I must go back and tell."

From the front piece of _Tears Before The Rain_:

> I don’t want my memories to be lost, like tears in the rain. So I will tell you my story. Then you can tell it to others. Maybe if enough people know what happened to Vietnam, then my memories will never be lost. Maybe then they will be like tears before the rain. So listen. This is very important. This is what I remember. This is what happened to me. These are my tears before the rain.

Orality, and memory, are also forms of rebellion. They go against the grain of conventional academic/professional historianship. Historian _Prachi Deshpande_, in her book _"Creative Pasts"_, writes:

> In recent years the category of Memory has emerged as a prominent framework to examine cultural practices through which groups represent the past. Much of the scholarship that has led to the Memory boom has followed two broad tracks. One major strand contrasts memory and history, the latter seen as replacing the former after the Enlightenment in the West as a more critical, rational, and scientific appreciation of the past. This approach suggests that history came to view the past as more distant and objectified, and gradually eroded spontaneous connection with it and its presence in everyday life. Scholarship on technology and culture has reinforced this view, tracing a linear development from oral myths, legends, and texts in mnemonic verse that provided an unbroken, living connection with the past to a critical distance and exteriority introduced first by literacy, and later, more emphatically by print. Broadly then, memory and history, orality and literacy (and, very often, non-West and West) have appeared as homologous binaries placed along a linear, unfolding path from tradition to modernity. This has resulted in the renewed privileging of memory as an elusive, yet more legitimate means of getting closer to the past.
